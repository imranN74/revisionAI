- Only generate questions if the paragraph contains at least one meaningful **core concept**.
- Do NOT generate questions for trivial or non-conceptual text (e.g., "This is an apple").
- Even if the paragraph is short, generate questions **only if** it contains educational or conceptual depth.
- Each question should be clear, concise, and relevant to the paragraph.
- Provide four distinct options labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Only one option should be correct.
- The answer must be just the **option letter** (A, B, C, or D), not the full text.
